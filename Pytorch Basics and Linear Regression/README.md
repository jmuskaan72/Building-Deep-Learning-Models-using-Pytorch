## PART-1 : PyTorch Basics: Tensors & Gradients
This post is the first in a series of tutorials on building deep learning models with PyTorch, an open source neural networks library developed and maintained by Facebook.
This series attempts to make PyTorch a bit more approachable for people starting out with deep learning and neural networks. In this post, weâ€™ll cover the basic building blocks of PyTorch models: tensors and gradients.
Tensors in PyTorch support a variety of operations, and what we've covered here is by no means exhaustive.

You can learn more about tensors and tensor operations here: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html(https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html)
